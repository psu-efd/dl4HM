*dl4HM* - Deep Learning for Hydraulic Modeling
=======================================================

*dl4HM* is a Python package developed to use deep learning for hydraulic modeling. It is based on TensorFlow 2.

- Build surrogate model to hydraulic models such as SRH-2D and HEC-RAS.
- Perform inversion, parameter calibration, and optimization. 

Dependencies
============
The easiest way to install all dependencies is to use the "environment.yml" file and conda:

.. code-block:: bash
    $ conda env create --name dl4HM -f environment.yml

which creates an environment named "dl4HM". You can change the name to suit your need.

Some of the pre- and post-processing functionalities involve the control of hydraulic models such as SRH-2D and HEC-RAS. They depend on the *pyHMT2D* (https://github.com/psu-efd/pyHMT2D) package.
