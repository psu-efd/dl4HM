Build a surrogate model for a backwater curve solver
=======================================================

The backwater curve sovler solves the 1D simple backwater curve equation. We vary the bathymetry $z_b$, simulate the backwater curve, and get the water surface elevation (WSE). 

All other inputs to the solver are fixed. 

The bed bathymetry profiles were generated with Perlin noise functions.
